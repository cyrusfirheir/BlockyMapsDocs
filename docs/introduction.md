## Introduction

*Blocky Maps* is tool made to facilitate an interactive and easy to setup grid-based map/world-navigation system for projects made with [Twine](http://twinery.org/) and using the [SugarCube 2](https://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/) storyformat.

*Blocky Maps* is both an interactive app to create such maps, as well as a library which can be added to Twine projects using the SugarCube 2 storyformat to display and run them.

The system uses JSON to store and move around the data associated with a map, and is as extendable as the user wants it to be.
